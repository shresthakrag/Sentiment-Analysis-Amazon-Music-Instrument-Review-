# Sentiment Analysis: Amazon Music Instrument Reviews

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon musical instrument reviews to extract insights about customer satisfaction and product performance. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the analysis classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral and identifies key factors influencing customer sentiment.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews dataset, which contains:
- Customer reviews for musical instruments sold on Amazon
- Review scores (1-5 stars)
- Review text
- Product metadata
- User information

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans, tokenizes, and normalizes review text
- **Sentiment Classification**: Uses machine learning to categorize reviews by sentiment
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies important keywords and phrases influencing sentiment
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides quantitative metrics on review sentiment distribution
- **Data Visualization**: Presents findings through graphs and charts

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- NLTK & spaCy for natural language processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## Results
The analysis reveals patterns in customer satisfaction with musical instruments, including:
- Common praise points in positive reviews
- Frequent complaints in negative reviews
- Correlation between review length and sentiment
- Product categories with highest/lowest satisfaction

## Future Work
- Implement more advanced NLP models (BERT, transformers)
- Add aspect-based sentiment analysis
- Create an interactive dashboard for exploring results
- Expand analysis to include product recommendations
